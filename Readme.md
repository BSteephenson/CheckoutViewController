# Checkout Library

I wanted to build a simple, easy to use UI component for checkout for iOS apps.

With this form, the user can

- add a new payment option
- select from existing payment options
- select a shipping option
- enter a shipping address

This also allows for setting defaults on the payment option, shipping option, and shipping address.

Just include the dist folder and masonry to your project to use. See checkout/ViewController.m for example usage

## TODO
- better delegate interface
- a gif of how this looks
- a way to add payment options after initially showing the form
- a way to hide the form elegantly
- prefixing the names of the classes I made
- actual documentation
- make this prettier

Feel free to leave feature suggestions or even a PR. =)
